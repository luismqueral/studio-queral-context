`gen-design-context` is an asset library intended to be used for generative, interactive prototyping with tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [v0](https://v0.dev).

The goal is to help you generative "Times-ian" artifacts without the aggrevation of starting from scratch.

### How do I use this?

If you're using _Cursor_, just download this project as a `.zip`, open the extracted folder in Cursor, and start building your project. A `.cursorrules` system prompt is provided by default, it's worth checking that out to see if it works for your project. Modify it as needed.

If you're using _v0_, you'll need to upload specific assets in the project settings.

💡 **Pro Tip:** It's helpful to be _deliberate_ and _selective_ about the context that you wish to add. Remove context that you probably won't need to avoid overwhelming the LLM.
