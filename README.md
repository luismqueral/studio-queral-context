`gen-design-context` is an asset library intended to be used for generative, interactive prototyping with tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [v0](https://v0.dev).

The goal is to help you generative "Times-ian" artifacts without the aggrevation of starting from scratch.

### How do I use this?

If you're using _Cursor_, just download this project as a `.zip`, open the extracted folder in Cursor, and start building your project. It's worth checking out the included `.cursorrule` to better understand the system prompt.

If you're using _v0_, you can upload specific assets in the project settings.

With both tools, its helpful to be deliberate and selective about the context that you wish to add. It also helps to remove context that you probably won't need to avoid overwhelming the LLM.
