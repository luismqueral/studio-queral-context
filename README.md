`gen-design-context` is a starter kit for interactive artifacts at *The New York Times*. It is intended to be used with LLMs and generative coding platforms like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [v0](https://v0.dev).

It includes our complete typography collection along with design tokens for colors, spacing, and semantic UI states.

You'll also find brand assets and logos for maintaining consistency across projects.

### How do I use this?

Download the repository as a zip file and take what you need for your interactive project. For example:

- Copy fonts from the `css/fonts/` directory for custom typography in your web app
- Use design tokens from `css/tokens/` to maintain consistent colors and spacing
- Reference the NYT logo from `misc/logos/` for branded headers or footers  
- Import the Tachyons CSS framework from `css/nyt-tachyons/` for rapid styling

### Contributing

Anyone is free to contribute to this library! If you have design assets, improvements to existing tokens, or new components that would benefit the NYT design community, we'd love to hear from you.

Please submit an issue first to discuss your proposed changes, then feel free to open a pull request. This helps ensure contributions align with the project goals and maintain consistency across the design system.
