`gen-design-context` is an framework-agnostic, NYT design asset library for generative, interactive prototyping. It's intended to be used alongside tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [v0](https://v0.dev).

The goal is to help you quickly make NYT-feeling artifacts without the aggrevation of starting from scratch.

### How do I use this?
If you're using _Cursor_, just download this repo as a `.zip`, open the extracted folder in Cursor, and start making your your project. A `.cursorrules` system prompt is provided by default, it's worth checking that out to see if it works for your project. Modify it as needed.

If you're using _v0_, you'll need to upload specific assets in the project settings.

💡 **Pro Tip:** It's helpful to be _deliberate_ and _selective_ about the context that you wish to add. Remove context that you probably won't need to avoid overwhelming the LLM.
