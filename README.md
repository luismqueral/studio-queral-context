`gen-design-context` is an asset library intended to be used for generative, interactive prototyping with tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [v0](https://v0.dev).

The goal is to help you generative "Times-ian" artifacts without the aggrevation of starting from scratch.

### How do I use this?

If you're using _Cursor_, just download the .zip , open the folder in Cursor, and start building your project.

If you're using _v0_, you can upload specific assets in the project settings.
