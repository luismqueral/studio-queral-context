`gen-design-context` is a starter kit for interactive artifacts at *The New York Times*. It is intended to be used with LLMs and generative coding platforms like [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) and [v0](https://v0.dev).

It includes our complete typography collection along with design tokens for colors, spacing, and semantic UI states.

You'll also find brand assets and logos for maintaining consistency across projects.

### How do I use this?

Download the repository as a zip file and take what you need for your interactive project. For example:

- Copy fonts from the `fonts/` directory for custom typography in your web app
- Use design tokens from `misc tokens/` to maintain consistent colors and spacing
- Reference the NYT logo from `logos/` for branded headers or footers  
- Grab HyperCard graphics from `images/` to add retro flair to prototypes
- Import the Tachyons CSS framework from `nyt-tachyons/` for rapid styling
