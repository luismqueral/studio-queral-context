`studio-queral-context` is a personal starter kit for prototyping and building interactive projects with [Cursor](https://cursor.sh).

It includes curated assets, fonts, graphics, and configuration to help quickly bootstrap new projects with a consistent creative direction.

### How do I use this?

Clone or download this repo, open it in Cursor, and start building. The `.cursor/rules/` directory contains system prompts and guidelines that inform how Cursor assists with development. Review and modify these rules to fit your project needs.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Be deliberate about what context you include. Remove unused assets and references to keep the AI focused on what matters for your specific project.
