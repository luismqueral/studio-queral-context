# TPL Cursor Rules

This directory contains Cursor rule templates for Times Product Language (TPL) development. These rules provide automated guidance for building iOS applications that comply with NYT design system standards.

## Rule Files

The `.mdc` files in this directory define specific coding standards and design system compliance patterns:

- **combined.mdc** - View organization and template usage guidelines
- **tpl-tokens.mdc** - Design token usage and color/typography standards  
- **brand2.mdc** - Brand compliance and visual identity rules
- **storylist.mdc** - Story list component guidelines
- **swift-ui.mdc** - SwiftUI-specific implementation patterns

## Usage

These rule files are designed to be imported into Cursor IDE to provide context-aware assistance when building NYT iOS applications. They ensure consistent application of design tokens, proper component structure, and adherence to brand guidelines.

## Implementation

Copy the relevant rule files to your project's Cursor configuration to enable automated design system compliance checking and suggestions during development.
