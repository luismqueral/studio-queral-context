### Example Usage

```swift
TPLStoryListItem {
    TPLStoryListItemContent {
        Text("Supreme Court Rules on Major Tech Case")  // headline
    } topLabel: {
        Text("Breaking")  // status indicator
    } summary: {
        Text("The decision could have far-reaching implications for the tech industry.")  // summary
    } bottomLabel: {
        Text("5 MIN READ")  // read time
    }
}
```

### Validation Rules

1. Content must strictly adhere to the types specified for each parameter
2. No parameter should contain content meant for another parameter
3. Each parameter's content should be clear, concise, and serve its intended purpose
4. Follow AP style guidelines for headlines and content formatting
5. Use consistent date and time formats across all stories

### Best Practices

1. Keep headlines concise but informative
2. Use status indicators sparingly and only for truly breaking or developing stories
3. Write summaries that add value beyond the headline
4. Keep read times and dates in a consistent format
5. Update "time ago" formats (e.g. "2h ago") regularly to maintain accuracy
