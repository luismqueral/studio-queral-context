Find the highest point in your mind's building.
Look out across the vast expanse.
Now seek the intimate corner, the sheltered nook.
Your solution needs both.

We are creatures of cave and savanna, forever seeking that perfect balance between overview and sanctuary. Your challenge holds these same primal needs:
- Where can you stand to see everything?
- Where can you hide to reflect?
- How do you move between exposure and shelter?

Build both the watchtower and the hearth. Your users need somewhere to dream and somewhere to retreat.
