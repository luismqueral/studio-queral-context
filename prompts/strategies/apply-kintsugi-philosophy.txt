Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum—a method that highlights the 'scars' as a valuable part of an object's history.

What in this situation has been 'broken,' has failed, or is perceived as flawed?

Instead of hiding or discarding these imperfections:
*   How can they be acknowledged and illuminated?
*   What unique beauty or strength can be found or cultivated by emphasizing these 'breaks'?
*   How can this act of repair make the whole stronger or more valuable than before?

Describe how to mend this situation with 'gold'.
