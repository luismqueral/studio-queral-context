Imagine it's a future point in time, and this project or initiative has failed catastrophically. Conduct a 'pre-mortem.'

Work backward from this hypothetical failure:
*   What were all the plausible reasons for this failure?
*   Which potential weaknesses, overlooked risks, or flawed assumptions contributed?
*   Be brutally honest and specific.

Now, return to the present. What proactive steps can you take *today* to mitigate the most significant risks identified in your pre-mortem? Strengthen your defenses before the battle.
