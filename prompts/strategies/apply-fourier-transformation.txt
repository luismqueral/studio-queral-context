Analyze as if performing a Fourier transform: decompose complex patterns into constituent frequency components.

What fundamental frequencies might underlie complex behaviors?

Detail how mathematical analysis could reveal simple, underlying patterns within apparently complicated phenomena. What are the basic waves in the noise?
