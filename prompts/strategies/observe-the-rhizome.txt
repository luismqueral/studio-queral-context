Consider this situation not as a hierarchical tree structure, but as a rhizome (like ginger or grass roots) – a subterranean stem that sends out roots and shoots from its nodes, with no central point, and capable of sprouting from any part.

*   Where are the unexpected connections and offshoots?
*   How could it spread or adapt if one part is blocked or removed?
*   What are the multiple entry and exit points?

Map its rhizomatic qualities. How does this decentered perspective change your strategy for interacting with or influencing it?
