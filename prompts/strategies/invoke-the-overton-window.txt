Consider your challenge through the concept of the Overton Window—the range of policies or ideas considered politically acceptable at a given moment.

*   Where are the current boundaries of 'acceptable' discussion or action in this context?
*   How might you strategically shift this window by introducing more extreme positions that make your actual targets seem moderate?
*   What previously 'unthinkable' approaches might actually offer breakthrough potential?

Detail how working with this dynamic of perceived acceptability might allow you to expand possibilities or drive change more effectively than operating solely within established parameters.
