When seedlings are too crowded, they compete for resources, and none thrive. Gardeners 'thin' them, removing some to allow others the space and resources to grow strong.

Are there too many initiatives, ideas, or priorities competing for limited resources (time, budget, attention) in this situation, leading to weak overall progress?

*   Which 'seedlings' show the most promise if given adequate space?
*   Which ones, though perhaps good ideas, need to be 'thinned out' to allow the strongest to flourish?

Describe your thinning strategy. How will you make the hard choices to ensure the vigor of the remaining efforts?
