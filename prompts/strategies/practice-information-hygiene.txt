In an age of information overload, what is the quality of information influencing this situation? Are there sources of 'noise,' misinformation, or outdated data polluting the environment?

*   Where is information being distorted or selectively filtered?
*   What crucial information is missing or hard to access?

Outline steps to improve information hygiene. How can you ensure decisions are based on clearer, more accurate signals?
