In architecture and urban design, 'soft edges' (e.g., landscaped setbacks, inviting entryways, permeable fences) create a more welcoming and integrated transition between public and private spaces, or between different zones, encouraging interaction and reducing abruptness.

Where in this situation are there 'hard edges'—abrupt transitions, impermeable barriers between teams, ideas, or stages of a process—that hinder flow or collaboration?

*   How can you introduce 'soft edges' to create more gradual, inviting, and permeable boundaries?
*   What would a 'landscaped' or 'semi-permeable' transition look like in this context?

Design for smoother integrations and more porous connections.
