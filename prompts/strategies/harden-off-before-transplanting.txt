Seedlings started indoors must be gradually acclimated ('hardened off') to outdoor conditions before being transplanted to prevent shock. If you are introducing a new idea, process, or change (the 'seedling') into a new environment (the 'outdoors'), how can you 'harden it off'?

*   What small, controlled exposures to the new conditions can you implement?
*   How can you gradually increase its interaction with the real-world complexities and pressures?

Detail your 'hardening off' plan to ensure the new initiative can survive and thrive once fully 'transplanted'.
