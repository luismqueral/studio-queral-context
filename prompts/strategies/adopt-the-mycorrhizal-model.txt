Mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, exchanging nutrients and information, enhancing resilience for both. What entities in or around this situation could form mutually beneficial, symbiotic partnerships?

Identify potential partners (individuals, groups, other projects).

*   What unique 'nutrients' (resources, skills, perspectives) could each offer the other?
*   How could this exchange create a stronger, more resilient 'ecosystem' for all involved?

Design a strategy for fostering these mycorrhizal connections.
