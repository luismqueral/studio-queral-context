The architectural principle 'form follows function' (Louis Sullivan) suggests that the shape of a building or object should primarily relate to its intended purpose. However, sometimes the available form dictates or inspires new functions.

Consider your current challenge:
*   **Form Follows Function:** Is the current 'form' (structure, process, team setup) optimally designed for its intended 'function' (goal, output)? If not, how must the form change to better serve the function?
*   **Function Follows Form:** Alternatively, are there existing 'forms' (skills, resources, technologies, relationships) whose inherent qualities might suggest or enable new, valuable 'functions' or opportunities you haven't considered?

Explore this duality. How can you align form and function, or discover new functions from existing forms?
