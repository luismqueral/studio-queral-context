Approach this situation with disciplined, systematic questioning to illuminate underlying assumptions and aporia (impasses in logic).

Engage key aspects or stakeholders (even hypothetically) in a Socratic dialogue:
*   Ask for definitions of core terms.
*   Uncover contradictions in stated beliefs or goals.
*   Probe the 'why' behind assertions until foundational assumptions are revealed.

What hidden truths, unexamined beliefs, or points of genuine confusion emerge from this rigorous questioning? How does this clarify the path forward?
