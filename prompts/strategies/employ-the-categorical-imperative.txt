Consider Kant's principle: Act only according to rules you could will to become universal laws.

What if everyone in this situation acted exactly as you propose?
Which of your principles could truly serve as universal laws?
How might this lens of universality transform your choices?

What changes when you evaluate your actions not just by their immediate effects, but by their fitness as universal principles?
