The success of any planting depends on the quality of the soil. In this situation, what is the 'soil' – the foundational environment, team culture, or underlying conditions?

*   Is it depleted, compacted, or lacking essential 'nutrients' (e.g., trust, resources, clear communication)?
*   What 'amendments' (e.g., training, new processes, open dialogue, resource injection) are needed to make it more fertile for growth and success?

Detail your 'soil test' and the specific amendments you'll introduce to improve conditions before 'planting' new initiatives.
