Consider this situation through Emmanuel Levinas's ethics of alterity: the face-to-face encounter with absolute otherness that precedes ontology, initiating infinite responsibility.

*   Who or what constitutes the radical 'Other' in this context?
*   How might you prioritize ethical responsibility to this otherness before questions of knowledge or utility?
*   What would it mean to be hostage to an infinite demand that can never be fully satisfied?

Detail how approaching through radical respect for alterity—rather than through categorization or appropriation—might transform your very conception of what this situation asks of you.
