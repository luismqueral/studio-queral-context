Consider this situation through the lens of Niccolò Machiavelli's pragmatic political philosophy from 'The Prince'.

*   Would it be better to be loved or feared in this context? Why?
*   How might calculated boldness be more effective than cautious half-measures?
*   What would it mean to be 'as cunning as a fox and as fierce as a lion'?

Without endorsing manipulation, describe how Machiavelli's strategic realism—seeing things as they are, not as they ought to be—might lead to more effective action in this situation.
