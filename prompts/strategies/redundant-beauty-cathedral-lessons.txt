A Gothic cathedral doesn't trust a single solution.
Flying buttresses layer upon flying buttresses.
Multiple paths carry the weight.
Failure of one doesn't mean collapse of all.

In this complexity lies grace:
* Where are your single points of failure?
* What beauty could emerge from overlapping systems?
* How might backup structures become features, not compromises?

Learn from the medieval masters - sometimes the support becomes the spectacle.
