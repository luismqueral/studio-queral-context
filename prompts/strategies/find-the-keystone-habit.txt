In habit formation, a 'keystone habit' is a single, small change that can spark a cascade of other positive changes. (Concept from Charles Duhigg).

Within this situation or project, what single practice, process, or behavior, if consistently implemented or changed, could create widespread positive ripple effects?

*   It doesn't have to be the biggest or most obvious thing.
*   It should be something relatively easy to start.
*   Its power lies in its ability to influence other patterns.

Identify a potential keystone habit and map out the chain reactions it might trigger.
