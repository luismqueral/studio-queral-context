Analyze this situation using game theory principles from political science, examining how strategic interactions shape outcomes when decisions depend on others' choices.

*   What type of 'game' is this—zero-sum, positive-sum, prisoner's dilemma, chicken, or stag hunt?
*   What are the payoff structures for different combinations of choices?
*   How might you alter incentives, signal commitments, or build trust to achieve better equilibrium?

Detail how this mathematical approach to strategic interaction might reveal optimal strategies when dealing with rational actors pursuing their own interests.
