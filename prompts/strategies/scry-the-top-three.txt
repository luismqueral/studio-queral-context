Like a well-timed Scry in Magic, look ahead: what are the next three most likely outcomes, obstacles, or decision points?

For each:
1.  Detail one action you could take *now* to improve your position or alter its trajectory.
2.  Decide: would you keep this 'card' on top of your library, or send it to the bottom?

How does this foresight change your immediate next step? Plan your draws.
