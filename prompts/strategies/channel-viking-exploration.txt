The Norse expanded across the North Atlantic through bold exploration, adaptive technology, and establishing strategic outposts.

*   What uncharted territories could you explore with your own version of the longship—technology perfectly adapted to your challenging environment?
*   How might you establish small, sustainable 'settlements' in new domains before committing larger resources?
*   What mix of trading, raiding, and colonizing would serve your purposes?

Consider the Viking approach: use superior mobility to reach places others cannot, establish self-sufficient outposts in hostile environments, and maintain flexible networks rather than centralized control. Where is your Vinland?
