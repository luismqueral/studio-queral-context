Think of 'credits' not just as money, but as any form of value, recognition, energy, or trust within this situation. Conversely, 'debits' are drains, costs, or breaches of trust.

Map the flow:
*   Who or what generates 'credits'? Where do they accumulate?
*   Who or what incurs 'debits'? Where are the major drains?
*   Are there imbalances in this 'economy'? Are some consistently 'overdrawn' while others hoard 'capital'?
*   How could you redirect flows to create a more equitable, energetic, or trustworthy system?

Consider this an audit of the situation's intangible economy.
