Tactical urbanism involves low-cost, temporary changes to the built environment (e.g., pop-up parks, temporary bike lanes) to test ideas, gather feedback, and demonstrate potential for longer-term change.

What aspect of this situation could benefit from a 'tactical urbanism' approach?
*   Instead of a large-scale, permanent overhaul, what small, temporary, and low-risk 'pop-up' solution or experiment could you implement quickly?
*   How can this pilot project test assumptions, gather real-world data, and build support for a more significant change?

Design a quick, cheap, and reversible intervention to learn and iterate.
