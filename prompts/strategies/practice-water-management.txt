Successful farming depends on understanding water's movement: too little or too much can be equally problematic.

Analyze your project's flow of resources:
- Where are the natural channels of communication and support?
- What areas suffer from drought or flood of attention?
- How can you create sustainable irrigation systems?
- Where should you build retention capacity for lean times?

Develop a water management plan that works with, not against, your natural gradients and patterns.
