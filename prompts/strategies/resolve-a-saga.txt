Envision this project as a three-chapter Magic Saga enchantment:

*   **Chapter I (Lore):** What foundational lore or setup initiates the Saga? What's the opening scene?
*   **Chapter II (Transformation):** What is the transformative action or turning point? What dramatic event unfolds?
*   **Chapter III (Resolution):** What is the lasting impact or new reality once the Saga concludes? What is the final, powerful effect?

Detail how each chapter builds upon the last to achieve a legendary outcome.
