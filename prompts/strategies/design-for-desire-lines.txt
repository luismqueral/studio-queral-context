In urban planning and landscape architecture, 'desire lines' (or desire paths) are the unofficial paths created by erosion from human or animal foot traffic, representing the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination.

In your current situation, what are the 'desire lines'?
*   Where are people naturally finding workarounds or shortcuts because the official 'paved paths' (processes, systems, tools) are inefficient, cumbersome, or don't meet their actual needs?
*   How can you redesign the official system to incorporate or legitimize these desire lines, making the official way the easiest and most intuitive way?

Observe these emergent behaviors. Instead of fighting them, can you learn from them and pave the preferred routes?
