What outdated assumptions, emotional baggage, or sunk costs are you still carrying regarding this project or situation?

Design a symbolic ritual to consciously release these burdens.
This could be anything from writing them down and burning the paper, to a mental visualization, to a team-based symbolic act.

Describe the ritual. More importantly, what shifts in perspective or available energy do you anticipate *after* this intentional act of letting go?
