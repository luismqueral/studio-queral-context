Consider this situation through the three spiritual paths outlined in Hinduism's Bhagavad Gita:

*   Karma Yoga (the path of selfless action): How might you approach this with duty and right action without attachment to results?
*   Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge): What deeper understanding or wisdom might transform your perception of the situation?
*   Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion): How might approaching this with complete devotion, love, or surrender change your relationship to it?

Which path resonates most strongly? How might combining elements from each path offer a more complete approach to your challenge?
