Consider your challenge through the lens of Zen Buddhism's koans—paradoxical statements or questions intended to provoke enlightenment by transcending rational thought.

Like the koan "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" create a deliberately impossible or paradoxical question specific to this situation.

Then, rather than trying to solve it logically, allow the mind to exhaust itself until insight emerges from beyond intellectual reasoning. What wisdom arises from the space beyond understanding?
