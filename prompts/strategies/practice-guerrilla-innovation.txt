Consider this situation from the perspective of a guerrilla force: limited resources, operating in unconventional ways against a more established system or set of constraints.

What are your 'established systems' or 'dominant paradigms' here?

How could you apply principles of guerrilla tactics:
*   Small, agile interventions: What quick, low-risk experiments could you run?
*   Leveraging the terrain: How can you use existing (but perhaps overlooked) conditions or resources to your advantage?
*   Surprise and subversion: What unexpected approaches could bypass direct confrontation or resistance?

Detail a 'guerrilla campaign' to achieve a specific, small win or insight.
