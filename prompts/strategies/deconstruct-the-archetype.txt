What dominant archetypes (e.g., the Hero, the Mentor, the Trickster, the Innocent) are consciously or unconsciously shaping perceptions or actions within this situation?

Identify one or two key archetypes at play.

Then, deconstruct them:
*   What are their underlying assumptions and expectations?
*   What limitations or blind spots do they impose?
*   What happens if you invert the archetype, or blend it with an unexpected counterpart?

Explore how stepping outside these archetypal roles might open up new behaviors or solutions.
