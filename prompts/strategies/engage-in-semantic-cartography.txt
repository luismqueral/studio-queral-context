The words we use shape our reality. Create a 'semantic map' of the key terms and concepts central to this situation.

For each key term:
*   What are its explicit definitions and connotations?
*   What related terms orbit it (synonyms, antonyms, associated concepts)?
*   Are there loaded terms, jargon, or euphemisms that obscure or distort meaning?

How does mapping this linguistic landscape reveal underlying assumptions, power dynamics, or areas of conceptual fuzziness? Could reframing or redefining key terms shift the entire map?
