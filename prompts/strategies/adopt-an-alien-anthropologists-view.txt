Imagine you are an anthropologist from a completely alien culture, observing this human situation for the first time. You have no preconceived notions about 'normal' human behavior or societal structures.

*   What rituals, customs, or unspoken rules would appear baffling or irrational?
*   What core motivations or beliefs would you infer from the observed behaviors?
*   What 'artifacts' (tools, documents, processes) would seem particularly strange or revealing?

Describe your 'field notes' as this alien anthropologist. What fundamental aspects of the situation become visible when stripped of cultural familiarity?
