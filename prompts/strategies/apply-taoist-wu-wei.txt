Consider this situation through the Taoist concept of Wu-Wei (无为)—'non-action' or 'effortless action'—an alignment with the natural flow of the Tao that achieves without forcing.

*   Where might you be struggling against the natural current of events?
*   How could you align your actions with existing momentum rather than opposing it?
*   What might emerge if you allow things to unfold according to their inherent nature?

Describe how embodying 'action through non-action' might paradoxically lead to effective outcomes with minimal resistance.
