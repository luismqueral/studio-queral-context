In physics, half-life is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half of its initial value. Apply this concept metaphorically to key elements of this situation.

*   What is the 'half-life' of current assumptions? How long until they are likely outdated?
*   What is the 'half-life' of the current solution's relevance or a team's enthusiasm?
*   What is the 'half-life' of a critical resource?

Thinking in terms of decay and renewal, how does this perspective influence planning, resource allocation, or the need for adaptability?
