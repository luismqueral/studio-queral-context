Approach this situation as if consulting the I Ching (Book of Changes), the ancient Chinese divination text. Rather than actually casting hexagrams, mentally engage with its core philosophy of change and balance.

*   What opposing yet complementary forces (yin/yang) are at work in this situation?
*   What is in process of transformation from one state to another?
*   What unchanging principles might provide guidance amid change?

Describe how viewing this situation as a specific moment within larger cycles of change might reveal its true nature and suggest a harmonious path forward.
