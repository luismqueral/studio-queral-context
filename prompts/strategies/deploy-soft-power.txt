Following Joseph Nye's concept of 'soft power,' consider how attraction and persuasion might be more effective than coercion or payment in this situation.

*   What cultural, intellectual, or moral resources could you leverage to attract others to your position?
*   How might you frame your approach to align with widely shared values or aspirations?
*   What legitimacy or credibility might be built through collaborative rather than confrontational methods?

Describe how strategically applying soft power might achieve your objectives while building long-term influence and goodwill.
