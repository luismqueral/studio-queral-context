Examine this situation through Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic lens: desire is structured around an absent core, a constitutive lack that can never be filled.

*   What fantasies of completeness or satisfaction might be driving your approach?
*   What fundamental lack or absence is being disavowed?
*   How might objectives be functioning as objet petit a—the unattainable object-cause of desire that gives shape to yearning?

Explore how acknowledging this essential incompleteness—rather than pursuing illusory wholeness—might transform your relationship to both problems and solutions. What might emerge if you work with lack rather than against it?
