Imagine a future state where this challenge has been successfully resolved or this goal perfectly achieved. This success is now a historical 'artifact.'

Reverse engineer it:
*   What key components make up this successful outcome?
*   What processes must have led to its creation?
*   What were the critical design choices or breakthroughs?
*   What 'materials' (resources, knowledge, support) were essential?

Working backward from this ideal future artifact, what steps become clear for its initial construction today?
