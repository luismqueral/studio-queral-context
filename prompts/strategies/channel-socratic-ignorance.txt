Embrace the paradox that true wisdom begins with acknowledging what we don't know.

What do you think you know that might be preventing deeper understanding?
How might systematic questioning reveal hidden assumptions?
What becomes possible when you adopt the stance of 'knowing that you don't know'?

Like Socrates, how might embracing your ignorance lead to deeper wisdom than defending your current knowledge?
