Consider the American Founding Fathers' federalist approach: creating workable systems from competing interests through structural compromise.

*   What fundamental tensions or competing interests exist within this situation?
*   How might these tensions be productively balanced rather than resolved in favor of one side?
*   What checks and balances or separation of powers could create sustainable equilibrium?

Describe how this federalist approach—designing systems that accommodate and balance legitimate differences rather than eliminating them—might create robust solutions for complex environments.
