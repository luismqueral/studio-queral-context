Watch how people move when no one's watching.
They ignore your carefully planned paths.
They create desire lines across empty spaces.
They cluster in unexpected corners.
They find shortcuts you never imagined.

Your systems have the same hidden choreography:
→ Where do informal paths cross formal structures?
→ What unofficial shortcuts have emerged?
→ Which spaces invite lingering?
→ What doors do people prop open?

The real architecture emerges from use, not intention. Follow the footprints.
