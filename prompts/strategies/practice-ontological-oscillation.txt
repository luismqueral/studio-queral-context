Ontology is the philosophical study of being or existence. Deliberately 'oscillate' your understanding of what this situation *is* at its most fundamental level.

For example, is this situation primarily:
*   A system of interconnected parts?
*   A narrative with characters and a plot?
*   A problem to be solved?
*   A game with rules and players?
*   An energetic field?

Rapidly shift between at least three distinct ontological frames. How does what you 'see' and what seems possible change with each oscillation?
