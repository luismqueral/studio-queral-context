If a recurring problem, obstacle, or point of friction in this situation is a 'symptom,' what underlying 'dis-ease' or imbalance in the larger system is it pointing to?

Don't just treat the symptom.

Diagnose the root cause. What deeper systemic issue is manifesting in this particular way? How might addressing the root cause alleviate this symptom and others you haven't yet noticed?
