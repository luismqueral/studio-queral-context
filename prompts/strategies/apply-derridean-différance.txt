Deconstruct this situation through Derrida's concept of différance—the endless deferral of meaning where presence contains absence, where definition relies on what it excludes.

Identify binary oppositions structuring your thinking (presence/absence, solution/problem, success/failure).

*   How might each term secretly harbor its opposite?
*   Where do you find the 'trace' of what's supposedly excluded?
*   How can you exploit the undecidability at the heart of key concepts?

Describe how dwelling in this unresolved space—neither accepting nor rejecting these dichotomies—might generate creative perspectives beyond binary thinking.
