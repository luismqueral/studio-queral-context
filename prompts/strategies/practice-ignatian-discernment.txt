Apply the Jesuit spiritual practice of discernment developed by St. Ignatius of Loyola: the deliberate process of distinguishing divine guidance from mundane thoughts and impulses.

*   First, clearly articulate the decision or path you're considering
*   Next, observe your inner movements: what brings consolation (peace, love, connection) versus desolation (fear, confusion, disconnection)?
*   Finally, reflect on where these feelings seem to lead—toward or away from your deeper values and purpose

What insight emerges when you distinguish between immediate emotional reactions and deeper spiritual indicators?
