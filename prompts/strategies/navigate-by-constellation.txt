Imagine the key elements, challenges, and goals of this situation are stars in the night sky.

Instead of focusing on a single 'North Star,' identify a constellation of 3-5 'stars' that, when viewed together, create a meaningful pattern or offer a guiding narrative.

*   What is this constellation? Name it.
*   How do the relationships *between* these points guide your understanding or next steps, rather than any single point in isolation?
*   How does this pattern help you navigate complexity or uncertainty?

Map your constellation and interpret its collective wisdom.
