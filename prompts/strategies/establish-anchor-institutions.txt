Anchor institutions (like universities, hospitals, or major cultural centers) are deeply rooted organizations that play a vital role in the economic, social, and civic life of a community. They are often stable, mission-driven, and have significant resources.

Within your project, organization, or initiative, what existing elements or which stakeholders could function as 'anchor institutions'?
*   What core, stable strengths or values can they provide as a foundation?
*   How can they be leveraged to attract other resources, foster community, or provide long-term stability and direction for surrounding, more volatile elements?

Identify your anchors and build out from their strengths.
