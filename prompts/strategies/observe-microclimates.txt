Even within a small garden, microclimates exist – small areas where conditions (sun, shade, moisture, wind) differ from the general environment. In this situation, what 'microclimates' exist within the larger project, team, or market?

*   Are there pockets of high performance, low morale, specific expertise, or unique resistance?
*   How do these localized conditions affect what can 'grow' there or what strategies are most effective in those specific zones?

Identify these microclimates and tailor your approach to their unique characteristics, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all strategy.
