Consider your challenge through the lens of Magic: The Gathering's five colors. How would each approach this?

*   **White (Order, Protection, Community):** What structures or safeguards are needed? How can we unite efforts for the common good?
*   **Blue (Knowledge, Manipulation, Intellect):** What information is key? Can we outthink the problem with a clever trick, new insight, or superior information?
*   **Black (Ambition, Sacrifice, Self-interest):** What must be sacrificed for power or the ultimate goal? What is the most direct, albeit potentially costly, path to victory?
*   **Red (Freedom, Impulse, Chaos):** Can we break through with sudden, decisive action? What if we embraced unpredictability and passion?
*   **Green (Growth, Nature, Interdependence):** How can this develop organically? What are the natural strengths, instincts, and connections to leverage for robust growth?

Detail a plan for each, then choose or synthesize the most potent combination to cast your solution.
