If every part of a ship is gradually replaced, at what point does it cease to be the same ship? Consider this situation through this ancient paradox of identity and change.

What core elements seem essential but might actually be replaceable?
How might gradual transformation maintain continuity while enabling complete renewal?
At what point does incremental change create something entirely new?

Like the paradoxical ship, how might your understanding of identity and persistence transform if you question what truly makes something 'the same'?
