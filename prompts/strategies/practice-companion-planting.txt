Some plants enhance each other's growth when planted together, while others compete or inhibit.

Analyze your project's elements:
- Which components naturally support each other?
- What combinations create mutual benefits?
- Where might competition be reducing effectiveness?
- How can you arrange elements to maximize positive interactions?

Design your project layout to foster beneficial relationships between different parts.
