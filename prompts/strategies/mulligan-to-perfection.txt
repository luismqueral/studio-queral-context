If your current strategy or initial resources were your opening hand in a high-stakes game, would you keep it or take a mulligan?

Detail what a 'perfect hand' (ideal starting conditions, resources, insights) for this challenge would look like.
What elements of your current 'hand' would you discard? What are you hoping to 'draw' by re-evaluating, even if it means starting with fewer resources (a metaphorical card down)?

Is it time to reshuffle and redraw?
