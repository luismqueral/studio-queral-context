Clear
    Translucent
        Frosted
            Obscured

Like a thoughtful glazing design, modulate the visibility of your system. Not everything needs to be exposed. Not everything should be hidden.

Play with layers:
- What should be immediately apparent?
- What should reveal itself slowly?
- What mysteries should remain?
- Where might a blur be more honest than clarity?

The art lies in knowing what to show, what to suggest, and what to conceal.
