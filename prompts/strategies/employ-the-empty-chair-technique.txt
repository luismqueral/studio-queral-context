Place an empty chair in the room (physically or imaginatively). This chair represents a key stakeholder, a dissenting voice, a future self, a core principle, or even an abstract concept (e.g., 'The User,' 'Ethics,' 'The Environment') not fully represented in current discussions.

Engage in a dialogue with the 'entity' in the empty chair.
*   What are their concerns, perspectives, or questions about the situation?
*   What would they advocate for or warn against?
*   Speak their part aloud, then respond from your own perspective.

What new insights or empathic shifts occur when you give explicit voice to this 'other'?
