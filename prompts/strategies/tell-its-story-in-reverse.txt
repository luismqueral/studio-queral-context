Take the current situation or a key process within it. Now, narrate its history, but start from the present moment and tell the story backward, event by event, until you reach its origin or a significant early point.

How does reversing the chronological flow change your understanding of causality, critical turning points, or the inevitability (or contingency) of the present state?

What overlooked 'beginnings' or alternative past trajectories become more apparent when the end is the starting point of your telling?
