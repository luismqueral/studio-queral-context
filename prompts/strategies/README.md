# Strategy Cards

These are creative thinking prompts designed to help you approach design challenges from unexpected angles. Each strategy offers a different lens through which to view your project.

### How do I use these?

Pick a strategy that feels relevant (or deliberately irrelevant) to your current challenge. Here's a sample prompt you might use:

```
I'm working on [describe your project briefly]. 

Please apply the strategy from "honor-the-shadows.txt" to help me think about this differently. 

Use the NYT design system assets from this repository as needed.
```

The strategies work particularly well when you're stuck, need fresh perspective, or want to push beyond obvious solutions. They're designed to unlock creative thinking that conventional approaches might miss.

💡 **Pro Tip:** The most powerful insights often come from strategies that initially seem unrelated to your problem. Don't overthink the selection—trust your intuition.
