Neither here
    Nor there
        But becoming

The Japanese call it ma (間), the Moroccans call it the courtyard, the Europeans their porticos. These in-between spaces - not quite inside, not quite outside - hold the magic.

Study your thresholds:
* Where do states change?
* What mediates between extremes?
* How long should transition take?
* What rituals mark passage?

The space between spaces is where transformation happens.
Remember: Even doors can be rooms.
