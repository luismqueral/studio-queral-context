*   What excess could be stripped away to reveal the essential?
*   What temptations or attachments might you need to confront?
*   What clarity might emerge through deliberate austerity and focused attention?

Describe how embodying this desert approach—temporarily removing yourself from abundance, convenience, and distraction—might transform your relationship to the challenge.
