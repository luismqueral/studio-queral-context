First, forget everything you want to add.
Instead, contemplate the spaces between.
The gaps.
The pauses.
The emptiness that gives meaning to form.

Like a Japanese master crafting an alcove where absence speaks louder than presence - what could you remove to make your idea stronger? Where might a carefully crafted void create more impact than any addition?

Remember: It's the space between the notes that makes the music.
