Like the prisoners in Plato's allegory, we often mistake shadows for reality. Question your most fundamental assumptions about what's 'real' in this situation.

What shadows are you mistaking for substance?
Which comfortable illusions might you need to abandon?
How could ascending to a higher perspective transform your understanding?

What would happen if you turned away from the familiar shadows and faced the source of light?
