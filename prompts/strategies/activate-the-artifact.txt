Identify a core assumption, process, or overlooked asset that functions like a powerful Magic artifact with a hidden, game-changing activated ability.

What 'mana cost' (resources, effort, risk, unconventional thinking) is required to activate it?
What potent effect, perhaps one not originally intended for this 'artifact,' could it produce if tapped?

Describe how activating this latent power might bypass a standard limitation or create an unexpected advantage. Tap into hidden power.
