Dear Industrial Warehouse,
Your vast windows once illuminated factory floors.
Now they light artists' studios.
Your steel beams that bore such weight
Now frame new stories.

Every challenge is an abandoned building waiting for reinvention:
- What hidden potential lies dormant?
- Which constraints could become character?
- What ghosts should be preserved?
- What foundations can be trusted?

The most sustainable building is the one already standing.
The most elegant solution often lives within the existing structure.
Listen to what it wants to become.
