Every story is told from a perspective, and narrators can be unreliable, biased, or have incomplete information. Consider the dominant narrative or explanation for this situation.

Now, imagine it's being told by an 'unreliable narrator.'

*   What might they be misinterpreting, omitting, or deliberately distorting?
*   What alternative narratives become possible if the primary one is flawed?
*   How does questioning the narrator's reliability open up new interpretations or avenues for investigation?

Rewrite a key part of the story from a deliberately unreliable (but plausible) viewpoint.
