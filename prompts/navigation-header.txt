Build a navigation header component using NYT design system standards.

Assets to reference:
- Franklin font family for navigation items (fonts/franklin/franklin-normal-500.woff2 and franklin-normal-600.woff2)
- NYT T logo (logos/New_York_Times_T_icon.svg) positioned according to brand guidelines
- Dark theme color tokens from misc tokens/tpl-color-tokens-dark.css
- Size tokens from misc tokens/tpl-size-tokens.css for consistent spacing
- Semantic colors from misc tokens/ink_semantic-colors-inverse-(dark).css

Implementation notes:
- Header should be sticky with proper z-index layering
- Use NYT Tachyons classes for layout and spacing consistency
- Include hover states and focus indicators for accessibility
- Reference brand book guidelines for logo placement and sizing
- Implement responsive behavior that works across device sizes
