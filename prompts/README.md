# Prompts

This folder contains example prompts for generative design tools like Cursor that reference specific assets from this repository. Effective prompts should reference exact file paths from the repository structure (fonts/, logos/, misc tokens/), specify which design tokens to use for consistency, and include context about NYT brand guidelines and accessibility requirements. Structure prompts with clear intent, specific asset references, and any relevant constraints or requirements to ensure outputs align with the design system standards.
