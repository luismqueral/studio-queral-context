Design a flexible card grid system component for article previews using NYT design tokens.

Design system references:
- Headlines: Karnak condensed (fonts/karnak-cond/karnak-cond-normal-600.woff2)
- Metadata text: Franklin small (fonts/franklin-small/franklin-small-normal-500.woff2)
- Body preview: Imperial regular (fonts/imperial/imperial-normal-400.woff2)
- Color scheme: Light theme tokens (misc tokens/tpl-color-tokens-light.css)
- Typography scale: Reference misc tokens/tpl-typography.css for consistent sizing
- Spacing: Use size tokens from misc tokens/tpl-size-tokens.css

Grid requirements:
- Responsive breakpoints using NYT Tachyons grid system
- Cards should have consistent aspect ratios and spacing
- Hover effects that maintain brand consistency
- Support for featured articles with larger card sizes
- Accessible focus states and semantic markup
- Follow UX principles outlined in misc context/ux-tenents.md
